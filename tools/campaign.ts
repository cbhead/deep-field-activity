/**
 * Campaign arc probe. `npm run campaign`.
 *
 * The same greedy auto-builder the balance probe uses, pointed at every
 * (level × difficulty) pair instead of just Switchback at standard. It answers
 * one question the single-level sweep cannot: **is each new board winnable, and
 * does the campaign actually get harder in the order it claims to?**
 *
 * Read it as a shape, not as scores. What should be true:
 *
 * - Standard is winnable on every level with a mixed build, with fewer lives
 *   kept as the campaign goes on.
 * - Recon is comfortable everywhere — it is the tier for learning a board.
 * - Blackout is a real threat on level 3 and survivable on level 1.
 *
 * A level nobody can clear on Standard is a content bug; a level cleared at
 * full lives on Blackout is a level that is not pulling its weight.
 *
 * Deliberately not a gate, for the same reason `tools/sweep.ts` is not: this
 * reports numbers a human has to judge. The one thing it *does* assert is that
 * every campaign map parses, because a malformed board is unambiguously wrong.
