/**
 * Bank floor sweep. `npm run bankfloor`.
 *
 * `BANK_FLOOR` was chosen while it was also, by accident, the opening budget of
 * every fresh run — an absent `?bank` parsed as `0`, so the floor set the money
 * on the first board of every campaign. It was picked at 0.6 because that was a
 * playable *start*, which is not the question it is actually meant to answer.
 * With the parse fixed the floor does one job and only one: decide what a
 * player who arrives at a sector poor gets handed.
 *
 * That job has a failure mode at each end, and a single number has to sit
 * between them:
 *
 * - **Too low is a dead end.** Below the cheapest station the player owns
 *   nothing, can buy nothing, and therefore earns no bounty. The sector cannot
 *   be played rather than being hard. This is the failure the floor was added
 *   for and it is the easy half to see.
 * - **Too high is a subsidy.** If arriving broke gets you most of a normal
 *   opening anyway, then spending to zero costs nothing and the decision the
 *   carry rule exists to create — hold cash back, or convert it to towers now —
 *   is not a decision. The mechanic is still in the code and no longer in the
 *   game.
 *
 * So it measures two things at each candidate floor.
 *
 * **Does it strand?** The whole arc played continuously by a greedy builder
 * that buys whenever it can afford to, and so arrives at every hand-off with
 * close to nothing. This is the worst realistic reader of a rule about saving
 * and it is what finds the dead end.
 *
 * **Does arriving poor still cost you?** The same sector played twice — once
 * opening on the floor, once opening on a healthy carry — and the difference
 * between them. This is the sentence the `BANK_FLOOR` comment already claims
 * ("arriving poor still costs you") stated as a number instead of a hope. If
 * the two columns converge, the floor has stopped being a floor and become the
 * opening budget again, which is the bug this file was written after.
 *
 * An earlier draft tried to model the other half as a *saver* — a builder that
 * stopped buying two waves out and banked the difference. It was discarded and
 * is worth recording as a dead end: stopping early does not model holding cash
 * back, it models not defending the hardest waves, and the saver lost sector
 * one on Standard at every floor including 1.0. It measured the handicap, not
 * the saving. Comparing a poor opening against a rich one needs no builder
 * policy at all, which is why this version does that instead.
 *
 * Two blind spots, both of which change how far the output can be pushed.
 *
 * The builder only spreads. It never upgrades and never holds cash back, so
 * every absolute figure here is a floor rather than a forecast — a human who
 * upgrades will clear boards this says are unwinnable. Read the *gaps* between
 * rows, which is the part the builder's weakness does not move.
 *
 * And the arc column is blank for Blackout, in the sense that it reads 0/15 at
 * every floor. That tier cannot clear sector one under this builder at any
 * money — `tools/campaign.ts` shows the same thing — so the run never reaches a
 * hand-off and the floor is never exercised. Blackout's rows therefore rest
 * entirely on the synthetic poor-vs-rich comparison, which injects a bank into
 * sectors two and three directly. That is a weaker form of evidence than the
 * other two tiers get and any Blackout conclusion should be hedged accordingly.
 *
 * Deliberately not a gate, like `sweep.ts` and `campaign.ts`: it reports
 * numbers a human has to judge.
