/**
 * Balance sweep. `npm run sweep`.
 *
 * Runs whole matches headlessly under different numbers and reports how each
 * strategy fared. It exists because balance is the part of this game that is
 * actually hard, and eyeballing a table of stats does not answer it.
 *
 * **Read the marginal block, not the mono-build rows.** "Can a defence built
 * entirely around one station win?" was the original question and it is the
 * wrong one: it is only answerable by a station that kills things, so asking it
 * of a slow guarantees a false failure. Singularity wins 0/5 alone and is worth
 * more to a real build than either of the others — tuning it until it wins alone
 * means handing it damage, which collapses three stations back into three ways
 * to do the same thing. The mono rows are still printed, but as a check for a
 * *dominant* station; a weak one there means nothing on its own.
 *
 * It mutates BALANCE / TOWERS / ENEMIES between runs. `as const` is compile-time
 * only and every consumer reads these objects at call time, so this drives the
 * real simulation with different values rather than a copy of it.
 *
 * Deliberately not a gate. `tools/check.ts` asserts things that must be true;
 * this reports things a human has to judge.

 * contribution and not an artefact of a changed build order.

 *
 * **The tier is probed, not assumed**, for the reason `boardMarginal` spells
 * out at length: a lives delta only has resolution inside a band. This block ran
 * at Standard for its whole life and was fine there while the reference build
 * was three stations. At four it finishes on 19.6 of 20 — six tenths of a life
 * from the ceiling — and every column collapses toward zero or toward the whole
 * reserve, which reads like data and is not. Overclock measured `+0.2` there and
 * the number meant nothing at all.
 *
 * `wait` only. Rushing is a separate axis and mixing it in here would fold two

/**
 * What each of the six stations is worth, board by board.
 *
 * The map spec's §4 made five predictions about what routes do to the roster,
 * and said plainly that none of it needs a number changed — that the geometry
 * does the work on its own. This is the block that checks that, because the
 * claim is falsifiable and was never tested:
 *
 *   Lance (pierce)      down, sharply — pierce pays by file length and a split
 *                       halves every file. Braid should be its floor.
 *   Nova (splash)       roughly flat — a lane still clumps, there are just two.
 *   Arc (chain)         up — chain needs proximity, not alignment, and it is
 *                       the only thing that reads a merge well.
 *   Singularity (slow)  down as a force multiplier — it no longer manufactures
 *                       the file Lance wants.
 *   Filament (ramp)     up on Delta, down elsewhere — a ramp wants one target
 *                       held, and only Delta's trunk gives that.
 *
 * Method is the same as the three-station block above: drop one station from
 * the full build and read the lives delta. Dropping one slot from a 1:1:1:1:1
 * cycle leaves the survivors in the proportion they had, so the delta is the
 * station's contribution rather than an artefact of a changed build order.
 *
 * **Difficulty is chosen per board, and that is the measurement, not a
 * convenience.** A lives delta only has resolution in a band. Below it the base
 * build already finishes on zero, the drop finishes on zero too, and every
 * station reads `+0.0`; above it the base finishes untouched on full lives and
 * every station reads `+0.0` again. Both look like data and neither is: the
 * first says the instrument is on its floor, the second that it is on its
 * ceiling.
 *
 * Run at Standard, the five new boards floor. Run at Recon, the first four
 * saturate at 30/30. There is no single tier that puts all eight inside the
 * band — so each board is measured at the hardest tier its reference build
 * still clears while actually losing something, and the tier is printed in the
 * row. A row that could not find one is marked, because "no tier works" is a
 * fact about the board worth seeing rather than a gap to fill with zeroes.
 *
 * The ranking is chosen per board by running the full build both ways and
 * keeping the better — a player is allowed to pick the right strategy, and on
 * these boards picking it is most of the game.
