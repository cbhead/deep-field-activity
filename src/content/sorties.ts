/**
 * What you can send at the other player, and what it costs.
 *
 * The offensive half of the era ladder. `TowerDef.era` says which stations a
 * rung opens; this says which contacts it lets you *send*, and the two together
 * are what makes an advance worth banking for — one purchase widens both what
 * you can hold with and what you can threaten with.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **The roster is the threat, not a multiplier.** The plan had sorties scaling
 * on the sender's era as well as being gated by it, so that getting ahead made
 * every send hit harder. Built, that is two compounding curves to tune against
 * each other and one of them duplicates the other's job. Being two rungs up
 * already means sending Monoliths into a board that can only answer with Mk I
 * stations — that *is* the threat, and it needs no second dial. So a sortie
 * scales on the **receiver's current wave**, exactly like the neutral wave it
 * arrives beside, and the era decides only which line of this table you may buy.
 *
 * A useful consequence: a sortie is never stale. One bought at wave 3 and one
 * bought at wave 30 are both a real contact for the board they land on, and
 * neither the sender nor the receiver has to reason about whose clock applies.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Price is derived, never authored.** `sortieCost` is the scaled bounty times
 * `BALANCE.sortie.markup`, so what a contact costs to send is a fixed multiple
 * of what the defender earns for killing it. That is one rule doing three jobs:
 *
 *  - it self-scales with the wave, so no second cost curve needs sweeping
 *    against `bountyGrowth`;
 *  - it makes spam structurally self-defeating, because every send into a wall
 *    is a transfer to the person you are attacking;
 *  - it prices the roster automatically. A Monolith's bounty is 34 against a
 *    Drifter's 6, so it costs about six times as much and lands three lives
 *    rather than one — worse per life on paper, and better in practice exactly
 *    when their line is thin enough that it arrives. That trade is the deck.
 *
 * `weight` is the one authored number, and it is what stops the correct answer
 * always being the cheapest hull per dollar. See `EnemyDef.leakDamage`.
