   *
   * **`kickback`** — the fraction of the price returned when a sortie reaches
   * their core. Below 1, so aggression is never free; high enough that a send
   * which lands is clearly worth having made. At 0.6 against a markup of 2.2,
   * a sortie that lands costs you 1.3 bounties and takes at least one life,
   * and one that dies costs you 2.2 and hands them 1. Those are the two swings
   * the mode is made of, and the gap between them is the whole design.
   *
   * **Unswept**, like the era costs. The property to sweep for is that
   * *neither* pure strategy wins: a player who never sends should lose to one
   * who sends well, and a player who sends constantly should lose to one who
   * builds. If sending always wins, raise `markup`; if it never does, raise
   * `kickback` before touching the markup — the markup is what keeps spam
