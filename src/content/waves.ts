/**
 * Front Line's neutral arc — a **cycle**, not an arc.
 *
 * Versus runs `Rules.endless`, so this table wraps: composition repeats every
 * ten waves while `hpGrowth` keeps compounding on the true index. Wave 11 is
 * wave 1's shape at ten times the hull. That changes what a table is for. A
 * campaign table is a teaching order, introducing each contact one wave before
 * it matters; this one is a **rhythm**, and it has to read as one from any
 * entry point because after wave 10 every entry point is the middle.
 *
 * Two rules follow from that, and both are why this is not a campaign table
 * with the serial numbers filed off:
 *
 * **Every group is `s()`.** The neutral wave is dealt evenly across both lanes,
 * always, so it never favours one — it is a third party pressing equally on
 * two players, not a rubber band. Every asymmetry on this board is bought by
 * somebody. A lane-pinned neutral group would be the arc taking sides.
 *
 * **The tenth wave has to hand back to the first.** A campaign table can end on
 * a finale because nothing follows it. Here wave 10's stragglers are still
 * walking when wave 11 — which is wave 1 — starts spawning, so the finale is
 * followed immediately by the opening at ten times the weight. It is dense but
 * short, and it front-loads its hull, so what is left on the board when the
 * cycle turns over is motes rather than Monoliths.
 *
 * Lighter than any campaign table by design. Sorties land on top of this, and a
 * neutral arc tuned to be survivable alone would be unsurvivable with an
 * opponent. `tools/sweep.ts` re-baselines it; these are pacing guesses.
