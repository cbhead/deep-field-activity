 * The pulsar at the goal: radius **in tiles**, stroke width, alpha.

 * Several rings at falling alpha rather than one at a constant one. That
 * falloff is the whole difference — a single even ring reads as a targeting
 * reticle borrowed from the HUD, while a stack that fades outward reads as
 * something emitting, which is what the thing the creeps are walking towards
 * ought to look like.
 *
 * These used to be fractions of a single tile, which made the game's entire
 * loss condition a 40px detail at the board's edge — smaller than any station,
 * and nowhere the eye would already be when a leak happened. Now they reach
 * `PULSAR_REACH`, and the outermost two are faint enough to read as bloom
 * rather than as more rings.
