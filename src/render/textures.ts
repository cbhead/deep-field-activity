 * cross along their shared borders, tracing the grid perfectly. Four coins, not
 * one cloud. A flat coat was added to fight it and only turned the cross into a
 * seam.
 *
 * The containment was never a design choice; it was a constraint of baking. So
 * the cloud moved to `buildNebula` in `mapLayer.ts`, where it is drawn in board
 * space and its puffs are free to overhang tiles — which is the entire fix.
