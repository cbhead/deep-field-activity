/**
 * What each contact is, as geometry.
 *
 * Pure, colour-free, Pixi-free — the `stationShape.ts` precedent, applied to the
 * other half of the roster. `textures.ts` scales it to pixels and bakes it;
 * `icons.ts` scales it to a viewBox and emits SVG. Neither imports the other,
 * and a legend that drew a different silhouette from the board would be exactly
 * the drift these modules exist to prevent.
 *
 * **Everything is in units of `R`** — the contact's own body radius,
 * `def.radius × TILE_PX`, which is the same quantity `worldView` scales the
 * sprite by. That is what lets one set of numbers hold across a roster whose
 * radii span 2.7×: a Mote and a Monolith are the same shapes at different
 * sizes, not different shapes.
 *
 * Angles are degrees clockwise from three o'clock, as `COLLAR_SECTORS` uses.
 *
 * Each part carries **either** a lightness multiplier `k` **or** an `alpha`,
 * never both. That is not a style rule: `k` resolves to a literal colour through
 * `step()`, while `alpha` means "let what is behind show through". A part that
 * did both would be asking to be composited two ways at once, and the bake and
 * the SVG would disagree about which won.
