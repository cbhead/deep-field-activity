 *  - **One representation.** Colours are numbers, because that is what Pixi
 *    takes; the HUD's CSS custom properties are generated from those same
 *    numbers by `applyHudTheme`. The background used to be written twice, as
 *    `0x0f172a` here and `#0f172a` in the stylesheet. Now it cannot drift.
