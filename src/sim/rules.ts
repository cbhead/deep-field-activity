/**
 * What a run is playing: which arc, and how hard.
 *
 * The sim used to reach straight for the `WAVES` table and `BALANCE`'s starting
 * figures, which is fine while there is exactly one of each. A campaign makes
 * both a per-run choice, and this is the object that carries that choice from
 * the menu down to the spawner without any system in between needing to know a
 * campaign exists.
 *
 * Every function that takes a `Rules` defaults it to `DEFAULT_RULES`, and
 * `DEFAULT_RULES` is byte-for-byte the game as it was before the campaign: the
 * Switchback arc at the swept baseline. That default is why `tools/check.ts`
 * and `tools/sweep.ts` did not have to change, and why Race mode is still the
 * same game — Race passes nothing, so it gets the baseline, so the N2 fairness
 * gate keeps meaning what it meant.

/**
 * Bind a campaign level and a difficulty tier into one run's rules.

 * carried cash were a bonus on top, banking would be free and the decision it
 * is meant to create — spend now or keep it for the next sector — would not
 * exist. Replacing makes leftover cash genuinely yours and genuinely at risk.
 *
 * A sector entered poor is therefore possible and is meant to be, but it is
 * floored at `BANK_FLOOR` of the tier's own starting money. Unfloored, the rule
 * had a dead end rather than a hard mode: a normal run finished Switchback on
 * $44–$101 against a cheapest station of $75, so the next sector opened with no
 * towers, no way to buy one, and therefore no bounty ever. The floor sits below
 * every tier's normal start, so arriving poor still costs you — it just cannot
 * cost you the ability to play.
 *
 * **The height of that floor is load-bearing and was wrong.** A builder that
 * spends to zero lands on the floor every time, so the floor is not a safety
 * net for that player — it is their opening budget for every sector after the
 * first. At 0.6 that meant playing seven of the eight boards on $150 when they
 * are tuned at $250, and the campaign could not be finished on Standard at all.
 * See the note on `BANK_FLOOR` for why the fix was the floor rather than the
 * boards.
 *
 * Beyond that the bank is uncapped, so hoarding really does compound. That is a
 * deliberate choice rather than an oversight: the run is the player's to make
 * lopsided if they want to.
