 * around 0.3% of a frame. Spatial partitioning would be pure cost.
 *
 * Two details that are easy to get wrong:
 *
 * - **Squared distances, never `Math.sqrt`.** This is the one loop in the game
 *   that runs often enough for it to matter.
 * - **Re-target every tick, no caching.** Caching produces the classic bad
 *   behaviour where a tower keeps tracking a creep that something else is about
 *   to kill, while a fresh one walks past it.
