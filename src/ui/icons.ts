 * this one is a vector at whatever size a button needs, and sharing a path
 * string across a Pixi `poly()` and an SVG `d` would couple two renderers for
 * decoration.
 *
 * The **mark inside it** is a different matter and comes from
 * `stationShape.ts`, shared with the bake. Five identical glyphs made the roster
 * unlearnable at a glance, and the fix is only worth anything if the shape the
 * deck teaches is the shape the board shows. That is the same argument that
 * already made `COLLAR_SECTORS` shared, applied one level down.
 *
 * Everything is `currentColor`, so a caller sets `color` once on the slot and
 * the whole glyph follows — including the states where it dims.

 * A contact, drawn as the board draws it.

 * The wave preview used to describe the wave in words — "4 Warden" — which

 * about to see. Now it is the same silhouette, from the same numbers.
 *
 * **Shared, unlike the station hexagon.** It used to be a second
 * implementation, defensibly so while a contact was two primitives and a seam
 * ratio. Six distinct silhouettes made that indefensible: a Bulwark is a hull,
 * six lit wedges and a core, and nobody is going to keep two copies of that
 * agreeing by hand. Geometry comes from `contactShape`, colour from the same
 * `step()` the bake calls, so a legend that disagreed with the board would now
 * have to be a bug in one shared function rather than drift between two.
 *
 * **No `currentColor`.** One colour cannot express a six-wedge Bulwark, so the
 * glyph resolves its own values and carries the token as an inline `color` for
 * the CSS glow to pick up. That is what retires the generated `.c-<id>` rules.
 *
 * **Size is compressed, not proportional.** Radii run 0.17 to 0.46, a 2.7x
 * span: drawn literally at chip scale a Mote would be nine pixels against a
 * Monolith's twenty-six and simply illegible. The band preserves *order* — which
 * is the information — while keeping the smallest readable.
